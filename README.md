## 1. Introduction

ECG-QRS-Extract is a Matlab-based software application designed to extract QRS complexes from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The software implements algorithms and signal processing techniques to identify QRS complexes accurately, aiding in the analysis and diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities.

This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and information on how to contribute to the project.

## 2. Features

ECG-QRS-Extract offers the following key features:

- **QRS Complex Extraction**: Detect QRS complexes from raw ECG signal data.
- **Signal Preprocessing**: Preprocess the ECG signal to remove noise and artifacts.
- **QRS Classification**: Classify QRS complexes as normal or abnormal based on morphological features.
- **Visualization**: Plot the original ECG signal along with identified QRS complexes for visual inspection.

## 3. Installation

To use ECG-QRS-Extract, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your machine with the appropriate version.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or download the ZIP file and extract it.

3. Open the Matlab script or project file associated with the application.

4. Place your ECG signal data in a suitable format for the script to read. Ensure you have the necessary permissions for accessing the data.

## 4. Usage

1. Load your ECG signal data into the Matlab environment. The data should be in the appropriate format (e.g., a vector or a time series).

2. Run the script or execute the functions to preprocess the ECG signal and extract the QRS complexes.

3. The script will output the detected QRS complexes along with any additional information or visualizations.

4. Analyze the results and use them for further research or clinical purposes.

Please note that the accuracy of QRS complex extraction may vary depending on the quality of the ECG signal and the parameters used in the algorithms.

## 5. Dependencies
